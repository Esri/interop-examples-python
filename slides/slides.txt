Agenda

 - Geoprocessing tools from 30000 feet (validators, model builder, etc)
 - Designing a tool to wrap something that's already there (subprocess use cases)
 - Writing a tool in ArcObjects
    - C++
    - C#

Why Write a Geoprocessing Tool?

 - Integration with ArcGIS
 - Validation
 - Layer of sanity checks/conversions

--

Script Tool Framework to the Rescue

 - Easy design and organization of tools
 - Can execute arbitrary .exe files
 - Python

--

Subprocess

 - Communicate via stdin/stdout/stderr

Using Python Script Tools as Interop for ArcObjects

--

Why Write a Tool in ArcObjects?

 - Familiarity
 - Performance
 - Customization

--

Why Not Just Do the Whole Tool in C++/C#?

 - Development time
 - Script tool wizard
 - DLL/Typelib/Assembly registration
 - Rapid prototyping
     - Get it "good enough" in Python 
     - Instrument and optimize away the bottlenecks

Calculate Area Field

 - Two params:
     - FeatureClass in
     - New field name
 - Behavior:
     - Add field of type double to Feature Class
     - Populate with area of shape for that record

--

C++

 - Actually not too hard (Smart Pointers are awesome)
 - Easiest integration path, best bang for buck

--

C# (or any .Net language)

 - Python for .Net: http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/
 - Or build on the C++ example
