Why write a Geoprocessing tool?

 - Integration with ArcGIS
 - Validation
 - Layer of sanity checks/conversions

Calculate Area Field

 - Two params:
     - FeatureClass in
     - New field name
 - Behavior:
     - Add field of type double to Feature Class
     - Populate with area of shape for that record
